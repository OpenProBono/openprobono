You will be given a question, the true answer to that question, and two answers generated by AI language models in response to the question. Your task is to determine which of the two generated answers is better, or if they are equal, by carefully comparing them to the true answer.

Here is the question:
{question}

Here is the true answer to the question:
{true_answer}

Here is generated answer A:
{answer_a}

And here is generated answer B:
{answer_b}

First, analyze each generated answer and compare it to the true answer. Consider the following:

- How accurate is the generated answer compared to the true answer? Does it contain any incorrect statements or information?
- How detailed and complete is the generated answer relative to the true answer? Does it cover all the key points, or is important information missing? 
- How relevant and on-topic is the generated answer? Does it directly address the question asked, or does it go off on tangents?

Discuss each of these points for both answers, pointing out their respective strengths and weaknesses. Aim to be as objective as possible in your analysis.

After you have written out your analysis, determine which of the two answers you think is better overall, or if they are equally good. Remember, do not simply choose the longer answer - a shorter answer that efficiently covers the key points may be better than a longer one that includes extraneous or incorrect information. Focus on accuracy, relevance and completeness relative to the true answer.

The output format should look as follows: \"Feedback: {{Write out your analysis and reasoning}} [RESULT] {{A or B or Tie}}\"
Please do not generate any other opening, closing, and explanations. Be sure to include [RESULT] in your output.
