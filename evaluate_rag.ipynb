    "# OpenProBono RAG Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is based on [RAG Evaluation](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/rag_evaluation) by [Aymeric Roucher](https://huggingface.co/m-ric).\n",
    "\n",
    "Any section inside block quotes is a direct quote. The general structure is copied and ideas are paraphrased. Prompts are adjusted to fit OpenProBono's use case. Code has been added and modified.\n",
    "\n",
    ">This notebook demonstrates how you can evaluate your RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), by building a synthetic evaluation dataset and using LLM-as-a-judge to compute the accuracy of your system.\n",

    "\n",
    ">Since there are so many moving parts to tune with a big impact on performance, benchmarking the RAG system is crucial.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">For our evaluation pipeline, we will need:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">1. An evaluation dataset with question - answer couples (QA couples)\n",
    ">2. An evaluator to compute the accuracy of our system on the above evaluation dataset.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">➡️ It turns out, we can use LLMs to help us all along the way!\n",
    ">\n",
    ">1. The evaluation dataset will be synthetically generated by an LLM 🤖, and questions will be filtered out by other LLMs 🤖\n",
    ">2. An [LLM-as-a-judge](https://huggingface.co/papers/2306.05685) agent 🤖 will then perform the evaluation on this synthetic dataset.\n",
