    "# OpenProBono RAG Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is based on [RAG Evaluation](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/rag_evaluation) by [Aymeric Roucher](https://huggingface.co/m-ric).\n",
    "\n",
    "Any section inside block quotes is a direct quote. The general structure is copied and ideas are paraphrased. Prompts are adjusted to fit OpenProBono's use case. Code has been added and modified.\n",
    "\n",
    ">This notebook demonstrates how you can evaluate your RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), by building a synthetic evaluation dataset and using LLM-as-a-judge to compute the accuracy of your system.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">For an introduction to RAG, you can check [this other cookbook](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/rag_zephyr_langchain)!\n",

    ">\n",
    ">Implementing any of these improvements can bring a huge performance boost; but changing anything is useless if you cannot monitor the impact of your changes on the system’s performance! So let’s see how to evaluate our RAG system.\n",

    "### Evaluating RAG performance\n",
    "\n",
    ">Since there are so many moving parts to tune with a big impact on performance, benchmarking the RAG system is crucial.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">For our evaluation pipeline, we will need:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">1. An evaluation dataset with question - answer couples (QA couples)\n",
    ">2. An evaluator to compute the accuracy of our system on the above evaluation dataset.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">➡️ It turns out, we can use LLMs to help us all along the way!\n",
    ">\n",
    ">1. The evaluation dataset will be synthetically generated by an LLM 🤖, and questions will be filtered out by other LLMs 🤖\n",
    ">2. An [LLM-as-a-judge](https://huggingface.co/papers/2306.05685) agent 🤖 will then perform the evaluation on this synthetic dataset.\n",

       "      <td>The Board may require that an applicant for registration as an appraisal management company or a registrant consent to a criminal history record check. Refusal to consent to a criminal history record check may constitute grounds for the Board to deny registration to an applicant or registrant. The Board shall ensure that the State and national criminal history of an applicant or registrant is checked. The Board shall be responsible for providing to the State Bureau of Investigation the fingerprints of the applicant or registrant to be checked, a form signed by the applicant or registrant consenting to the criminal record check and the use of fingerprints and other identifying information required by the State or National Repositories of Criminal Histories, and any additional information required by the State Bureau of Investigation in accordance with G.S. 143B-1209.42. The Board shall keep all information obtained pursuant to this section confidential. The Board shall collect any fees required by the State Bureau of Investigation and shall remit the fees to the State Bureau of Investigation for expenses associated with conducting the criminal history record check.\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nIf an applicant's or registrant's criminal history record check reveals one or more convictions listed under subdivision (a)(2) of this section, the conviction shall not automatically bar registration. The Board shall consider all of the following factors regarding the conviction:\\n\\n(c)\\n\\n(1)\\t (2)\\t (3)\\t (4)\\t (5)\\n\\n(6)\\n\\n(7)\\n\\nThe level of seriousness of the crime. The date of the crime. The age of the person at the time of the conviction. The circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime, if known. The nexus between the criminal conduct of the person and the job duties of the position to be filled. The person's prison, jail, probation, parole, rehabilitation, and employment records since the date the crime was committed. The subsequent commission by the person of a crime listed in subdivision (a)(2) of this section.\\n\\nIf, after reviewing these factors, the Board determines that the applicant's or registrant's criminal history disqualifies the applicant or registrant for registration, the Board may deny registration of the applicant or registrant. The Board may disclose to the applicant or registrant information contained in the criminal history record check that is relevant to the denial. The Board shall not provide a copy of the criminal history record check to the applicant or registrant. The applicant or registrant shall have the right to appear before the Board to appeal the Board's decision. However, an appearance before the full Board shall constitute an exhaustion of administrative remedies in accordance with Chapter 150B of the General Statutes.</td>\n",

The person's prison, jail, probation, parole, rehabilitation, and employment records since the date the crime was committed. The subsequent commission by the person of a crime listed in subdivision (a)(2) of this section.\\n\\nIf, after reviewing these factors, the Board determines that the applicant's or registrant's criminal history disqualifies the applicant or registrant for registration, the Board may deny registration of the applicant or registrant. The Board may disclose to the applicant or registrant information contained in the criminal history record check that is relevant to the denial. The Board shall not provide a copy of the criminal history record check to the applicant or registrant. The applicant or registrant shall have the right to appear before the Board to appeal the Board's decision.
