    "# OpenProBono RAG Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is based on [RAG Evaluation](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/rag_evaluation) by [Aymeric Roucher](https://huggingface.co/m-ric).\n",

    "Any section inside block quotes is a direct quote. The general structure is copied and ideas are paraphrased. Prompts are adjusted to fit OpenProBono's use case. Code has been added and modified.\n",

    ">This notebook demonstrates how you can evaluate your RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), by building a synthetic evaluation dataset and using LLM-as-a-judge to compute the accuracy of your system.\n",
